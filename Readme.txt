Description: How to run jupyter notebook ?
This project contains Jupyter Notebooks for data analysis tasks. The notebooks are organized based on specific analysis tasks or datasets.
Dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib (optional, depending on visualization requirements)
- Seaborn (optional, for advanced visualization)
How to Run:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.12 installed on your machine.
3. Install Jupyter Notebook if you haven't already by running:
pip install jupyter
4. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.
5. Start Jupyter Notebook by running the following command:
jupyter notebook
6. This will open a new tab in your web browser showing the Jupyter file browser.
7. Navigate to the notebook you want to run and click on it to open.
8. Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute the code cells and analyze the data.
Example:
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run Jupyter Notebook:
4. Click on the notebook named "Analysis_on_ASD_Detection.ipynb" to open it.
5. Execute the code cells by clicking on them and pressing Shift + Enter.
6. Follow the instructions within the notebook to analyze the data.
Additional Notes:
- Jupyter Notebooks provide an interactive environment for data analysis, allowing you to mix code, visualizations, and explanatory text.
- Ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed to run the code within the notebooks.
- You can customize the analysis by modifying the existing notebooks or creating new ones based on your requirements.
